##Desktop Application
###A description of the title of course

Here's a paragraph of text, just for fun. All of your data is private, protected, and secure. Files and folders uploaded to Bitcasa are encrypted using AES–256 bit encryption and sent over a secure connection using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

All data is encrypted client-side before being sent to Bitcasa. Because data is stored as encrypted blocks, we have no idea what files the blocks belong to. We can’t decrypt your data, either. Since we can’t decrypt it, we can’t see it. Data is decrypted and reconstructed only when you log in with your username and password. Your personal documents always remain personal. Keep in mind that you can retrieve any version of your files by simply picking a date or time on the versions calendar in the web portal.
