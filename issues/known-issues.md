When initially uploading a mirrored folder to Bitcasa, if the network connection is interrupted for a prolonged amount of time before being re established, the user may find that the remaining content will not upload. Our engineers are aware of this issue, and are currently working to fix it.

In the meantime, a user can select *Stop Mirroring to Bitcasa*,and then mirror the folder again so that it uploads completely.

####CORE 1912 - Missing files after large copies
