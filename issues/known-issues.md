####Login Credentials Not Remembered (Windows)

There is an issue where the Windows desktop client will ask a user to login upon startup, even if the Remember Password option has been enabled. Our developers are aware of this issue, and are working on creating a permanent fix. In the meantime, below are instructions for a workaround:

1. Uninstall Bitcasa
Click *Start* and then click *Control Panel*.
Click *Uninstall a program* under Programs.
Select Bitcasa and then click *Uninstall*.
2. Delete the Configuration File
Click *Start*, type *%appdata%* in the Start Search box, and then click *Roaming* in the list.
Locate and delete the folders named *com.bitcasa.Bitcasa* and *Bitcasa*.
3. Download the most recent version of Bitcasa here: <https://www.bitcasa.com/download>
4. Reinstall Bitcasa.
5. Enter your login credentials and close Bitcasa. Bitcasa will then bypass the login screen upon opening the application.
