##All about the Web Portal
###View and manage all of your files from the web

####What is Bitcasa web access?
Bitcasa web access (https://my.bitcasa.com) is a web interface for accessing your content and managing your account. You can play your music, watch movies, or view photo albums and documents. You can also upload files to Bitcasa, or download files to your computer or mobile device. You can also share any of your files easily with friends and family. In addition, the web portal allows you to browse through old *versions* of your files and folders so you can go back and recover previous versions of your files. 

####How do I roll back or restore a previous version?
Bitcasa stores unique versions of all your files and folders, forever. This means that you can *rollback* your data to any date and time in history. You can then download that version of any file or folder to your local device. See [this article](#) for instructions on how to revert files to a previous version.

####Can I edit documents within the web portal?
Not at the moment. You'll need to download the file, make your changes, and re-upload the file. 

####Can I access the web portal from my mobile web browser?
Yes! Just head over to https://my.bitcasa.com using your mobile browser. For the best mobile experience, download our mobile apps on Google Play or the App Store.

####How does the web portal play videos? What file types are supported?
The web portal will attempt to play file natively in your browser using HTML5. If your web browser can't play the file, we 'll quickly transcode the file into flash to be accessible on all platforms.

####What are the browser requirements?
You'll need a browser that supports HTML5. We recommend the latest stable release of Chrome, although Internet Explorer 9+, Safari 5.1.2+ and Firefox 9+ will all work well.

####I want to reorganize my files and folders, can I do this in the web portal?
It's not currently possible to reorder your data within the web portal. This can be completed in the desktop application. The new order will sync across and be reflected in the portal. 

####Can I delete my data from the web portal?
Yes. However, you'll be unable to delete files and folders that are *mirrored*. 

####I don't see any thumbnails!
Try logging out and then back in to the web portal. You should see your thumbnails appear after a fresh login. 

####How can I upload more than one file or folder at a time?
To upload multiple files, hold Ctrl (PC) or Command (Mac) when you clicking to select multiple files. There's no way to upload multiple folders just yet. 

####How do I share a file or folder?
You can easily share your photos, videos, documents, and more with friends and colleagues, even if they don't have Bitcasa. To share files from the web portal: 

1. Sign-in at https://my.bitcasa.com 
2. Click on the *Share* icon next to the folder or file.
3. In the dialog box, click *Copy Link*.
4. Send the link to anyone over email, IM, Facebook, Twitter, etc.

####Why is everything downloaded in a .zip file? 
Whenever you download more than one file, we compress everything in to one folder. 

####How can I delete something? Are there any limitations?
To delete content, click on the trashcan icon on the right side of the row belonging to your file.
