##Security Information
###Everything you need to know about security and privacy

All of your data is private, protected, and secure. Files and folders uploaded to Bitcasa are encrypted using AES-256 bit encryption and sent over a secure connection using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

All data is encrypted client-side before being sent to Bitcasa. Because data is stored as encrypted blocks, we have no idea what files the blocks belong to. We can't decrypt your data, either. Since we can't decrypt it, we can't see it. Data is decrypted and reconstructed only when you log in with your username and password. Your personal documents always remain personal. Keep in mind that you can retrieve any version of your files by simply picking a date or time on the versions calendar in the web portal.

####Your billing information is protected
Sensitive information is stored using several layers of encryption in a segmented network with no public internet access.New encryption keys are generated on a daily basis, existing keys are rotated on a regular basis.

Sensitive information is encrypted by an SSL connection when in transit over public networks. SSL connections are limited to SSLv3 and TLSv1. Our billing system adheres to the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for Service Providers.

####Your data is always backed up
Bitcasa and Amazon keep redundant backups of all data over multiple locations to prevent the remote possibility of data loss. In the unlikely event that this redundancy were to fail, folders that you have chosen to Sync using Bitcasa will still contain copies of your files.

####Your data remains private
We guard your privacy to the best of our ability and work hard to protect your information from unauthorized access. Bitcasa employees cannot view the content of the files you store in your Bitcasa account. In addition, we employ a number of physical and electronic security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access.
