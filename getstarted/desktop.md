##Install Bitcasa on the desktop
###Space. You won't run out. Seriously. 

####Installing Bitcasa 

1. Download the Bitcasa Desktop Application from (http://www.bitcasa.com/download)
2. Double-click the **Bitcasa Setup** (PC) or the **Bitcasa_XXXX.pkg** (Mac) file to begin installation. 
3. Follow the onscreen instructions. You'll be prompted to pick an installation location first. You may need to enter your password  to authorize the application install. 
4. After you've completed the installation, you'll need to create a new account or login to your existing account. Name your computer and click *done*.
5. If this is the first time you've installed Bitcasa, you'll be prompted to mirror your folders. This is optional, and you can always mirror folders later. 
6. Open your Infinite Drive from **Finder** (Mac), the desktop (Mac or PC), or **Explorer** (Windows).
