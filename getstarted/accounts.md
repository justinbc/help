####<a id="password"></a>I forgot my password! How do I reset it? 

To reset your password, go to the [password reset](https://my.bitcasa.com/forgot-password) page, enter the email address you used to sign-up, and then click **Request**. 

You will receive an email with a reset link. Clicking the link will require you to answer your two security questions. If you successfully answer both questions, you'll be able to set a new password.
