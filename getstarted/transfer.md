Throw your data in your Infinte Drive to save space on your computer. Your Infinite Drive is kind of like an external hard drive that lives in the cloud. Because it's not really attached to your computer, it doesn't take up your local space, nor does it run out of space. Cool, huh? 

You can access your files from any computer or mobile device. Your files are streamed instantly to your other computers, your phone, or whatever else you have Bitcasa installed on. You'll definitely need an Internet connection to access your data. 

####Let's move some files! 

There are a few different ways to get your data to your Infinite Drive. Use whatever works best for you: 

1. Drag and drop your files into your Infinite Drive. 
2. Right-click on the file, select **Bitcasa** from the drop down menu, and then select **Copy this to Bitcasa**. 
3. Mirror your folders to Bitcasa. 

When you **mirror** a folder, you're not moving any data off of your local computer. As you make changes and add files to the mirrored folder, Bitcasa automatically syncs, or *mirrors* that data to your Infinite Drive. 

In other words, anything you add to a mirrored folder will be copied to your Infinite Drive. The file will be exactly the same! You can access the contents of your mirrored folder on any device. However, because the mirrored folder exists on a specific computer, you can't make any changes to those files from the web portal, or from your device. 

To mirror a folder: 

1. Open Windows Explorer (PC) or Finder (Mac). 
2. Locate the folder you want to mirror.
3. Select **Bitcasa** from the drop down menu. 
4. Select **Mirror this folder to Bitcasa**. 

**Note**: Mirrored files and folders have a green Bitcasa logo overlay.
