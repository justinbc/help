##Chrome Extension
###Get started with the Bitcasa Everhwere Chrome extension

####What is the Bitcasa Everywhere Chrome extension?

Bitcasa Everywhere allows you to download files you find anywhere on the Internet directly to your Bitcasa Account.

Files are then immediately accessible across all your devices (computer, phone, tablet, etc.). The extension uses Bitcasa's patented de-duplication techniques to optimize download speeds, making downloading large files much faster. And because you have infinite storage space with Bitcasa, you can download as much as you want without ever running out of space. 
 
Some examples of how to use the Bitcasa extension:

1. Download large files once, and access them across all your computers.
2. Download movies, photos and music straight to your Bitcasa account for easy access from your phone and tablet.
3. Save documents you are reading to Bitcasa for easy access later on your computer, phone, and tablet.

Remember, once you download anything into Bitcasa, you can instantly share with friends and family using the Bitcasa client or web portal.

####Where does it download to? 

When you first use the extension, we'll automatically create a *downloads* folder for you in your Infinite Drive. It's presently not possible to select a different folder, but we'll be adding that function in the future. 

####How can I download from sites that require authentication?

Right-click on the extension icon in Chrome and select *Manage*. You'll see an option that is checked by default. This tells the extension to use your current cookies for the website you're attempting to access. 

####Do downloads use my Internet connection?

No. Once you start a download with the extension, our servers will connect to the site and start the download for you. Since we're bypassing your connection and doing the leg work, you won't need to download and then upload the file again.

####Can I turn off my computer after starting a download?

Yes! After you've initialized the download, make some coffee, walk the dog, and get out of the house for a bit. Since we're not using your connection for the transfer, you don't have to worry about keeping your computer awake. 

####It looks like it downloaded the wrong file. What happened?

Many download or file sharing sites have download timers, or they'll make you wait in line until the file is ready to be served. Because the file isn't readily available, we're unable to follow those page redirects. 

####Can I view downloaded files with the Chrome extension?

Not at this time! We'll probably add some type of queue indicator in a future release.
